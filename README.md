##Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple game of tic tac toe that I made for the old free code camp projects. There are still some bugs here and there, and some ui materials I am still planning on implementing. Nonetheless the game is playable.

Its made with react through create-react-app so you can use `yarn start` to load into a localhost instance.
